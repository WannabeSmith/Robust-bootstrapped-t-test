Description: Tu & Zhou (1999) <pmid:10521864> showed that comparing the means of populations whose data-generating distributions are non-negative with excess zero observations is a problem of great importance in the analysis of medical cost data. In the same study, Tu & Zhou discuss that it can be difficult to control type-I error rates of general-purpose statistical tests for comparing the means of these particular data sets. This package allows users to perform a modified bootstrap-based t-test that aims to better control type-I error rates in these situations.
