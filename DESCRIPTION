Description: In datasets whose data-generating distributions are non-negative with excess zero observations, it can be difficult to find general-purpose statistical tests for comparing the means of these distributions while controlling type-I error. This R package allows users to perform a modified t-test that better controls type-I error in these particular datasets.
