In datasets whose data-generating distributions are non-negative with excess zero observations, it can be difficult to find general-purpose statistical tests for comparing sample means while controlling type-I error rates. This R package allows users to perform a modified bootstrap-based t-test that aims to better control type-I error rates in these particular datasets.
